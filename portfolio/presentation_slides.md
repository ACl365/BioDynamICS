## Overview

- **Project**: BioDynamICS - Physiological Dynamics Analysis Framework
- **Author**: Alexander Clarke
- **Date**: March 18, 2025
- **Purpose**: Analysis of physiological dynamics in critical care

---

## Problem Statement

- Critical care patients generate vast amounts of physiological data
- Traditional analysis methods focus on static thresholds and isolated measurements
- Complex dynamical patterns and interactions are often overlooked
- Early warning signs of deterioration may be missed
- Treatment optimization requires understanding of complex system dynamics

## Solution: BioDynamICS Framework

A comprehensive framework that integrates:

- Advanced signal processing
- Dynamical systems modeling
- Infection treatment simulation
- Interactive visualization
- Clinical decision support

All within a unified, extensible system

   - Measures overall physiological stress
   - Integrates multiple organ systems
   - Provides early warning of deterioration

2. **Critical Transition Detection**
   - Identifies early warning signs before clinical deterioration
   - Based on dynamical systems theory
   - Calculates Lyapunov exponents and other stability metrics

3. **Treatment Optimization**
   - Simulates infection-treatment dynamics
   - Optimizes dosing regimens
   - Predicts treatment outcomes
