# BioDynamICS: Biological System Dynamics in Critical Care

## Project Overview
BioDynamICS is an innovative framework for analyzing intensive care data using principles from dynamical systems theory, signal processing, and bioengineering. This project treats the human body as an interconnected system where disturbances in one physiological subsystem cascade through networks, producing complex temporal patterns.

## Project Goals
- Develop novel methods for analyzing patient trajectories in critical care
- Extract meaningful physiological patterns from clinical time series data
- Model complex interactions between organ systems and treatments
- Create actionable visualizations for clinical decision support

## Data Source
This project uses the MIMIC-III Clinical Database Demo, a publicly available dataset containing de-identified health data associated with ~130 ICU patients.

## Core Components
1. **Data Integration Framework**: Unifies patient records into comprehensive timelines
2. **Physiological Signal Processing**: Extracts meaningful patterns from vital signs and labs
3. **Dynamical Systems Modeling**: Models patient state evolution and stability
4. **Infection-Treatment Analysis**: Examines antimicrobial therapy effectiveness
5. **Clinical Visualization**: Creates interactive dashboards for decision support
