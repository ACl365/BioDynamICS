# BioDynamICS: Physiological Signal Processing Design Documentation

## 1. Overview

The Physiological Signal Processing module is a foundational component of the BioDynamICS framework that extracts meaningful patterns and features from clinical time series data. This document explains the design decisions, methodological approaches, and implementation details of this module, which serves as the bridge between raw clinical data and advanced physiological stability analysis.

## 2. Conceptual Framework

### 2.1 Multi-Domain Signal Analysis

Traditional approaches to physiological monitoring typically focus on simple statistical measures and threshold-based alerting. The BioDynamICS framework takes a more sophisticated approach by analyzing physiological signals across multiple domains:

1. **Time Domain**: Statistical features, trends, and variability measures
2. **Frequency Domain**: Spectral characteristics and dominant frequencies
3. **Wavelet Domain**: Multi-scale decomposition to capture transient patterns
4. **Stability Domain**: Complex measures that quantify system regularity and predictability

This multi-domain approach captures different aspects of physiological function and dysfunction, providing a more comprehensive assessment than any single analytical method.

### 2.2 Organ System Integration

A key innovation in our approach is the integration of measurements by organ systems, moving away from isolated vital sign assessment toward a more physiologically meaningful framework:

1. **System-Based Grouping**: Physiological measurements are grouped by the organ systems they reflect
2. **Integrated Assessment**: The health of each organ system is assessed using multiple complementary measures
3. **Cross-System Interaction**: Relationships between organ systems are analyzed to detect patterns of physiological stress

### 2.3 Allostatic Load Quantification

The concept of allostatic load—the cumulative physiological burden from chronic stress and adaptation—is operationalized in our framework:

1. **Breadth Component**: How many organ systems show signs of dysregulation
2. **Severity Component**: How severely each system is affected
3. **Weighted Integration**: Systems with greater clinical importance receive higher weighting

## 3. Implementation Design

### 3.1 Module Structure

The PhysiologicalSignalProcessor class is organized into several functional areas:

1. **Feature Extraction**: Methods for extracting features across multiple domains
2. **Stability Analysis**: Techniques for calculating stability metrics
3. **Organ System Assessment**: Methods for evaluating organ system health
4. **Allostatic Load Calculation**: Algorithms for quantifying overall physiological strain
5. **Timeline Processing**: Tools for processing complete patient timelines and analyzing stability over time

### 3.2 Key Design Decisions

#### 3.2.1 Feature Selection

The features extracted from physiological time series were selected based on:

1. **Clinical Relevance**: Prioritizing features with established clinical significance
2. **Statistical Robustness**: Selecting measures that perform reliably on irregularly sampled clinical data
3. **Computational Efficiency**: Balancing analytical depth with practical performance considerations
4. **Complementary Information**: Including features that capture different aspects of the signal

#### 3.2.2 Time Series Preprocessing

Several preprocessing steps address common challenges in clinical time series:

1. **Outlier Handling**: A hybrid approach combining statistical detection and clinical reference ranges
2. **Irregular Sampling**: Methods that account for non-uniform sampling intervals
3. **Missing Data Management**: Techniques to handle gaps without requiring imputation
4. **Detrending**: Optional detrending to focus on fluctuations around the trend

#### 3.2.3 Stability Metric Selection

For stability assessment, we implemented:

1. **Sample Entropy**: Measures complexity and unpredictability of time series
2. **Autocorrelation Decay**: Quantifies how quickly a system "forgets" previous states
3. **Variability Metrics**: Capture different aspects of signal variability (statistical, temporal, and frequency-based)
4. **Trend Analysis**: Detects systematic changes over time

#### 3.2.4 Organ System Scoring

The organ system scoring algorithm:

1. **Identifies Deviations**: Compares measurements to reference ranges
2. **Weights by Severity**: Larger deviations receive higher weights
3. **Combines Multiple Inputs**: Integrates information from multiple measurements
4. **Normalizes Scores**: Creates comparable scores across systems with different numbers of measurements

### 3.3 Integration with Other Modules

The Signal Processing module:

1. **Receives Input** from the Data Integration module (patient timelines)
2. **Provides Features** to the Dynamical Systems Modeling module
3. **Connects with** the Visualization module for clinical interpretation

## 4. Methodological Details

### 4.1 Time Domain Feature Extraction

The module extracts the following time domain features:

#### Basic Statistical Features
- Mean, median, standard deviation
- Minimum, maximum, range
- Skewness, kurtosis (distribution shape)
- Quartiles and interquartile range

#### Trend Features
- Linear trend slope and significance
- Rate of change (first derivative)
- Acceleration (second derivative)
- Cumulative sum (for tracking systematic deviations)

#### Variability Features
- Coefficient of variation
- Root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD)
- Percentage of adjacent points with difference > threshold
- Gini coefficient of successive differences

### 4.2 Frequency Domain Analysis

Frequency domain features include:

#### Spectral Power Features
- Total power
- Power in physiologically relevant frequency bands
- Peak frequency
- Spectral edge frequencies

#### Spectral Shape Features
- Spectral entropy
- Power ratio between bands
- Spectral flatness
- Spectral centroid

These features capture rhythmic and oscillatory patterns in physiological signals that may not be apparent in the time domain.

### 4.3 Wavelet Decomposition

Wavelet analysis provides:

#### Multi-scale Features
- Energy at different scales
- Scale-specific entropy measures
- Cross-scale correlations
- Wavelet entropy

This approach is particularly valuable for non-stationary physiological signals, as it captures transient patterns and scale-specific dynamics.

### 4.4 Stability Metrics

We implement several complementary stability metrics:

#### Sample Entropy
Sample entropy quantifies the predictability of a time series, with lower values indicating more regular patterns and higher values indicating more randomness or complexity.

The algorithm:
1. Embeds the time series in an m-dimensional space
2. Counts pattern matches within tolerance r
3. Compares pattern matches for dimension m and m+1
4. Calculates the negative natural logarithm of the ratio

#### Autocorrelation Analysis
Autocorrelation analysis examines how a signal correlates with delayed versions of itself:

1. Lag-1 autocorrelation: Correlation between consecutive points
2. Autocorrelation decay rate: How quickly correlation diminishes with increasing lag
3. First zero-crossing: The lag at which autocorrelation first crosses zero

Slower autocorrelation decay often indicates reduced system responsiveness.

### 4.5 Organ System Status Calculation

The organ system status algorithm:

1. Maps measurements to organ systems using the `organ_system_measures` dictionary
2. For each measurement, calculates deviation from reference range
3. Normalizes deviations to create comparable scores
4. Combines deviations into a system-level score
5. Tracks the number of abnormal measures and their severity

The resulting output includes:
- Overall system score
- Count of abnormal measures
- Maximum deviation
- List of specific abnormal measurements

### 4.6 Allostatic Load Calculation

The allostatic load algorithm combines:

1. **Breadth**: Proportion of organ systems showing abnormalities, weighted by system importance
2. **Severity**: Magnitude of abnormalities across all systems, weighted by system importance

The formula gives greater weight to severity (60%) than breadth (40%), as the degree of physiological disturbance is often more clinically significant than the number of systems affected.

### 4.7 Stability Analysis Over Time

Temporal stability analysis:

1. Divides the patient timeline into overlapping windows
2. Calculates features and metrics for each window
3. Tracks how metrics change across windows
4. Identifies trends and critical changes in stability
