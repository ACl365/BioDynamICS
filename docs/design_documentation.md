# BioDynamICS Design Documentation

## Initial Architecture Decisions

### Data Integration Module

**Design Approach**: We've implemented a modular data loader that handles the MIMIC-III data structure with key considerations:

1. **Chunked Loading**: The CHARTEVENTS file is large (75MB+), so we implemented a chunked loading strategy to handle it efficiently without memory issues.

2. **Timeline Representation**: Rather than storing separate tables, we create a unified patient timeline that integrates all events chronologically, making it easier to analyze temporal patterns.

3. **Flexible Event Types**: The system accommodates different event types (measurements, medications, procedures) with a common structure, facilitating unified analysis.

4. **Logging System**: All operations are logged with timestamps for debugging and documentation purposes.

### Why This Approach?

The unified timeline approach is inspired by research in healthcare time series analysis, which shows that temporal relationships between different measurements and interventions are more important than the individual values. This structure enables:

- Easier identification of temporal patterns
- Simplified calculation of derived features (e.g., time since last medication)
- More natural representation of a patient's clinical journey

## Implementation Notes

### Design Challenges

1. **Irregular Sampling**: Clinical data is irregularly sampled - lab tests and vital signs are taken at different frequencies. Our timeline approach preserves this structure for initial analysis, but future versions will need resampling for specific analyses.

2. **Missing Data**: Healthcare data contains significant missing values. Rather than imputing immediately, we preserve the missingness in the timeline to allow different handling strategies during analysis.

3. **Scale Considerations**: The full MIMIC dataset is much larger than the demo. Our implementation with chunked loading is designed to scale to the full dataset when needed.

## Next Steps

The next component will be the Physiological Signal Processor, which will:

1. Extract meaningful features from vital signs and lab values
2. Implement advanced signal processing techniques
3. Calculate stability metrics for physiological time series

This component will build directly on the unified timeline structure implemented in the data integration module.
