# BioDynamICS: Dynamical Systems Modeling Design Documentation

## 1. Overview

The Dynamical Systems Modeling component is a core module of the BioDynamICS framework that applies concepts from nonlinear dynamics and dynamical systems theory to analyze physiological time series data. This document explains the design decisions, methodological approaches, and implementation details of this module.

## 2. Conceptual Framework

### 2.1 Why Dynamical Systems Theory?

Traditional approaches to physiological data analysis typically focus on statistical methods and threshold-based alerting systems. While these approaches have value, they often fail to capture the complex, nonlinear dynamics of physiological systems. Physiological processes are inherently dynamical systems, with multiple feedback loops, time delays, and nonlinear interactions between components.

Dynamical systems theory provides a powerful framework for analyzing these complex systems:

1. **System Dynamics vs. Isolated Measurements**: Rather than treating each vital sign measurement as an independent data point, dynamical systems theory focuses on how these measurements evolve over time and how they relate to each other.

2. **Detecting Critical Transitions**: Dynamical systems can undergo sudden transitions between different states. These transitions are often preceded by subtle changes in system dynamics that statistical methods might miss but that dynamical systems techniques can detect.

3. **Characterizing System Stability**: Dynamical systems theory provides rigorous methods for quantifying system stability and resilience, which are crucial aspects of physiological health.

4. **Modeling Complex Feedback Mechanisms**: Physiological homeostasis relies on complex feedback loops that dynamical systems models can effectively capture.

### 2.2 Key Concepts in Dynamical Systems Theory

Several key concepts from dynamical systems theory inform our implementation:

1. **State Space Reconstruction**: Techniques like time-delay embedding allow us to reconstruct the underlying dynamics of a system from a single time series, revealing patterns that aren't visible in the original time domain.

2. **Lyapunov Exponents**: These measure the rate at which nearby trajectories in the state space diverge, providing a quantitative measure of chaos and stability.

3. **Recurrence Analysis**: Recurrence plots and recurrence quantification analysis reveal the tendency of a system to return to previous states, which can indicate periodicity, determinism, or chaotic behavior.

4. **Attractors and Bifurcations**: Physiological systems often exhibit attractors (stable patterns of dynamics) and can undergo bifurcations (qualitative changes in dynamics) that signal shifts between health and disease.

5. **Early Warning Signals**: Critical transitions in dynamical systems are often preceded by generic early warning signals like increased variance, autocorrelation, and skewness.

## 3. Implementation Design

### 3.1 Module Structure

The DynamicalSystemsModeler class is organized into four core functional areas:

1. **State Space Reconstruction**: Methods for embedding time series data into a state space that reveals the system's dynamics.
2. **Stability Analysis**: Tools for quantifying system stability and detecting chaotic behavior.
3. **Physiological Models**: Implementations of specific physiological system models based on differential equations.
4. **Critical Transition Detection**: Techniques for identifying early warning signals that precede critical transitions.

This modular design allows for targeted analysis depending on the specific clinical question and available data.

### 3.2 Key Design Decisions

#### 3.2.1 Time-Delay Embedding Parameters

One crucial decision in state space reconstruction is the choice of embedding parameters (time delay and embedding dimension):

- **Adaptive Parameter Selection**: Rather than using fixed parameters, we implemented methods to estimate optimal parameters for each time series, recognizing that physiological dynamics vary between patients and over time.
- **Multiple Estimation Methods**: For time delay estimation, we implemented both mutual information and autocorrelation methods, allowing for flexibility based on data characteristics.
- **False Nearest Neighbors**: For embedding dimension estimation, we implemented the false nearest neighbors algorithm, which is widely accepted in the nonlinear dynamics literature.

#### 3.2.2 Stability Metrics Selection

For quantifying stability, we made the following design choices:

- **Maximal Lyapunov Exponent**: This provides a direct measure of the system's sensitivity to initial conditions and has been shown to correlate with physiological stability.
- **Recurrence Quantification Analysis**: We included multiple RQA metrics (determinism, laminarity, average diagonal line) to provide a comprehensive view of system dynamics.
- **Fixed Point and Limit Cycle Detection**: We developed algorithms to identify potential fixed points and limit cycles in the data, which map to specific physiological states.

#### 3.2.3 Physiological Models

For modeling specific physiological systems:

- **Simplified Control-System Models**: We implemented simplified models of cardiovascular and respiratory dynamics based on feedback control principles, balancing physiological realism with computational efficiency.
- **Parameter Customization**: Models allow for parameter customization to simulate different physiological states or pathologies.
- **Numerical Integration**: We use SciPy's solve_ivp for reliable numerical integration of the differential equations.

#### 3.2.4 Critical Transition Detection

For early warning signals:

- **Multiple Metrics Approach**: We implemented several complementary early warning indicators (variance, autocorrelation, skewness) as no single metric is perfectly reliable.
- **Sliding Window Analysis**: Using a sliding window approach allows for tracking how early warning signals evolve over time.
- **Combined Indicator**: We developed a weighted combination of individual metrics to provide a more robust overall assessment of transition probability.

### 3.3 Integration with Other Modules

The Dynamical Systems Modeling module integrates with other BioDynamICS components:

- **Data Integration**: It uses the patient timelines created by the Data Integration module.
- **Signal Processing**: It builds on the preprocessing and feature extraction from the Signal Processing module.
- **Visualization**: It connects with the Visualization module for specialized visualizations of dynamical systems concepts.

This integration creates a seamless workflow from raw clinical data to sophisticated dynamical analysis.

## 4. Methodological Details

### 4.1 State Space Reconstruction

#### Time Delay Embedding
Time delay embedding reconstructs a multidimensional state space from a single time series. For a time series \(x(t)\), the embedded vector at time \(t\) is:

\[ \mathbf{v}(t) = [x(t), x(t+\tau), x(t+2\tau), ..., x(t+(d-1)\tau)] \]

where \(\tau\) is the time delay and \(d\) is the embedding dimension.

#### Optimal Time Delay Estimation
We primarily use two methods:

1. **Mutual Information**: The optimal time delay is the first minimum of the mutual information function, representing when consecutive values become maximally independent.
2. **Autocorrelation**: The optimal time delay can be estimated as the first zero-crossing or 1/e decay point of the autocorrelation function.

#### Embedding Dimension Estimation
We use the false nearest neighbors (FNN) method:

1. Embed the data in dimension \(d\)
2. Find nearest neighbors of each point
3. Check if these neighbors remain close when embedding in dimension \(d+1\)
4. If they separate significantly, they are "false neighbors"
5. The optimal dimension is when the percentage of false neighbors drops below a threshold

### 4.2 Stability Analysis

#### Lyapunov Exponent Calculation
The maximal Lyapunov exponent measures the rate of separation of infinitesimally close trajectories. Our implementation:

1. Embeds the time series in state space
2. Identifies nearest neighbors for each point
3. Tracks how the distance between neighbors evolves over time
4. Estimates the exponential rate of divergence

Positive Lyapunov exponents indicate chaos, zero indicates stability at a limit cycle, and negative values indicate stability at a fixed point.

#### Recurrence Quantification Analysis
Recurrence plots visualize when a trajectory returns to a region of state space it has visited before. From these plots, we calculate:

1. **Recurrence Rate**: The density of recurrence points
2. **Determinism**: The percentage of recurrence points forming diagonal lines
3. **Laminarity**: The percentage of recurrence points forming vertical lines
4. **Average Diagonal Line Length**: Related to the predictability horizon

#### Fixed Point and Limit Cycle Detection
Our approach identifies:

1. **Fixed Points**: Regions where the system velocity (rate of change) is consistently low
2. **Limit Cycles**: Periodic patterns detected through autocorrelation and phase space analysis

### 4.3 Physiological Models

#### Cardiovascular Model
Our cardiovascular model simulates the interaction between heart rate, blood pressure, and the baroreceptor feedback loop:

\[ \frac{dHR}{dt} = \frac{HR_{baseline} - HR - G_{baro} \cdot (MAP - MAP_{setpoint})}{T_{HR}} \]

\[ \frac{dMAP}{dt} = \frac{C_{HR} \cdot HR - R_{vasc} \cdot MAP}{T_{MAP}} \]

where:
- \(HR\) is heart rate
- \(MAP\) is mean arterial pressure
- \(G_{baro}\) is baroreceptor gain
- \(T_{HR}\) and \(T_{MAP}\) are time constants
- \(C_{HR}\) is cardiac contractility
- \(R_{vasc}\) is vascular resistance

#### Respiratory Model
Our respiratory model captures the interaction between respiratory rate, tidal volume, and CO2 levels:

\[ \frac{dRR}{dt} = \frac{RR_{baseline} \cdot (1 + \alpha \cdot Drive) - RR}{T_{RR}} \]

\[ \frac{dTV}{dt} = \frac{TV_{baseline} \cdot (1 + \beta \cdot Drive) - TV}{T_{TV}} \]

\[ \frac{dpCO2}{dt} = \gamma \cdot (VCO2 - RR \cdot TV \cdot k_{removal}) \]

where:
- \(RR\) is respiratory rate
- \(TV\) is tidal volume
- \(pCO2\) is partial pressure of CO2
- \(Drive\) is respiratory drive (function of pCO2)
- \(VCO2\) is CO2 production rate
- \(k_{removal}\) is a ventilation efficiency constant

### 4.4 Critical Transition Detection

#### Early Warning Signals
We calculate several early warning signals in sliding windows:

1. **Variance**: Increases near critical transitions due to critical slowing down
2. **Lag-1 Autocorrelation**: Increases near transitions as the system becomes slower to recover from perturbations
3. **Skewness**: Changes as the stability landscape becomes asymmetric near transitions
4. **Kurtosis**: Reflects changes in the distribution of fluctuations

#### Critical Transition Probability
We calculate a combined indicator from multiple early warning signals, weighted by their reliability and significance. This is transformed into a probability score using a sigmoid function.
